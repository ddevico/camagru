This project proposes to create a small web application allowing to realize basic assemblies using your webcam and predefined images.

A user of your site will have to be able to select an image from a list of stackable images (for example, frames or objects with doubtful utility), take a picture from his webcam and admire the result of a montage Worthy of James Cameron.

All images taken should be public, likeable and commentable.
